Code from contest for optimalization of matrix calculations (focused on multiplication).
Contest was organised by PhD Michał Przewoźniczek at Wrocław University of Science and Technology in 2021.

In comparison to unknown referential implementation, this code achieved:
* 200 times faster multiplication of big matrices
* from 2 to 3 times faster mix of calculations

This was the fastest implementation and it won 1st place.
